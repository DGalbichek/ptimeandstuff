How do you create an entire world from scratch?

What a question. And it just did the job. Welcome to this world! (I might also refer to it as *‘our world’*, and maybe later on it can be called other names.) Just by enquiring about it we’ve located something. It’s still a little abstract now but hang on.

So to sum up in advance what this is all about: well, creation. (Nonsense, it’s exploration at best!) One could argue that anything I can come up with is only something from the infinitely many possible things that anyone could come up with. Third paragraph only and it’s already brain bending, oh dear! (Is that excitement or dismay? Irrelevant.)

And now for our pseudo FAQ:

<div align="center" style="margin:5%;">
<p align="justify">Who is this for?<br>I really don’t want it to be just for me. (Time will tell.)</p>
<p align="justify">Where does this come from, where is it headed, what is the purpose and other questions enquiring about intentions and what to expect.<br>It’s just something that’s happening and that is all I know. I’ll create/explore and you can watch, listen or interact. You don’t have to though.</p>
<p align="justify">Warmest welcome if you do, farewell if you don’t.</p>
</div>
